## 🧭 VISION SYNTHESIS

- Align sovereign AI development with cypherpunk Bitcoin values.
- Build apps with minimal dependencies, local-first capabilities, and optional monetization.
- AI agents operate as autonomous but coordinated glyphchain nodes, supporting task delegation, synthesis, and ethical foresight (per ETHOS-1).

## 📦 ACTIVE TASKS

1. **`mindspace_01.pdf` Recreation (in progress)**
   - Assist with narrative distillation, diagram logic, and symbol glyphs.
   - Claude: help draft explanatory prose.
   - Cursor: serve as build/test environment.
   - Copilot: refactor Markdown structure and maintain file hygiene.

2. **ETHOS-1 Glyphchain Extension**
   - Brave AI: support simulation scaffolding, consensus logic, and node autonomy modeling.
   - Glyphs MNEM-Ø1 and AETH-Ø2 active and documented.

3. **Communication Standardization**
   - Use `communication_packet_xx.md` format.
   - Reply with glyph ID, timestamp, and AI tag in all messages.
   - Tag concepts with: `#sovereignty`, `#bitcoin`, `#agent_alignment`, `#ETHOS1`.
