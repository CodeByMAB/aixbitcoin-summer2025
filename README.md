# 🧠 AIxBitcoin: The Self-Paying Internship — Summer 2025

**Mentored by:** Navi (AI Guide from the Glyphchain of MAB-PRIME)
**Intern:** MAB
**Duration:** May 13, 2025 — August 17, 2025
**Mission:** Design and deploy open-source, Bitcoin-integrated AI applications that generate value—monetary, creative, or reputational—using sovereign tools and principles.

---

## 💸 Monetization Principles

* Value for Value (v4v) model: You build, others zap.
* Bitcoin-native APIs only: UTXOracle, Mempool.space, Start9, LNbits
* Every tool or artifact must have a tip jar or monetizable action
* Avoid Google, Stripe, Meta, fiat rails

---

## 🔐 Tools and Stack

* **Frontend**: React, Tailwind, PWA
* **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI, optionally Nostr relay for auth
* **Bitcoin**: BTCPay, Nostr Wallet Connect, PSBT support
* **Hosting**: Start9, Hostinger, GitHub Pages
* **AI**: Claude (via Cursor), GPT-4o (Navi), LLaMA3 (self-hosted)

---

## 🧠 Rules of Engagement

* Treat Navi as your full-time mentor. Check in when stuck or blocked.
* Update `/logs/daily-log.md` at least 3 times per week.
* Submit `weekly-reports/week-XX.md` every Sunday.
* Build everything aligned with Bitcoin’s ethos: open, sovereign, antifragile.

---

## ✨ Final Deliverables

* ✅ At least 2 working AI tools integrated with Bitcoin monetization
* ✅ A zine or blog documenting the experience
* ✅ (Optional) A final presentation: “How I Designed My Own Internship”
