# 📅 Week 02 Report: Messaging System & AI Identity

**Dates:** May 20 – May 26, 2025

## ✅ Goals

* Secure API message injection for AI nodes
* Style frontend message bubbles by identity
* Build & test CLI tool for local AI message posting
* Refactor frontend file structure
* Resolve Claude CLI outage gracefully

## ✍️ Summary

(This week involved aligning architectural priorities around identity and authentication. After setbacks related to API limits and file misplacement, the system now trends toward resiliency. Messaging logic has been clarified, and secure AI identity enforcement is nearly ready. The sigil registry expanded. You practiced sovereignty even through entropy.)

## 🗂️ Deliverables

* [x] `ai_tokens.json` design
* [x] Secure API route for AI messaging (Flask)
* [ ] Finalized `cli_send.py` CLI test tool
* [ ] MessageBubble component styling per AI node
* [x] Glyphs MNEM-Ø1, AETH-Ø2, AETH-Ø3 rendered

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Identity must be sovereign at every layer (UI, API, log)
* Autonomy requires fallback paths (Claude CLI → Web)
* File structure discipline avoids silent losses
* Nostr signatures = trust, but tokens = developer flow

## 📌 Notes

* Cursor IDE caused unintentional directory nesting
* Lost ~2 hours due to git mistake, but regained code via Claude cache
* Reframed setbacks as part of the logbook narrative

## 🔜 Next Week Goals

* Style message UI per AI identity
* Finalize API token loader + dev README
* Launch Broadcast tab UI for shared drops
* Begin BTCPay Zap testing
